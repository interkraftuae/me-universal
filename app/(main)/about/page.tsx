              ME Universal is a smart infrastructure and technology solutions
              company focused on delivering intelligent building systems that
              enhance operational efficiency and support responsible energy use.
              Established in 2014, we work closely with developers, consultants,
              and project stakeholders to integrate advanced technologies into
              modern buildings and infrastructure projects. Our role is to
              connect innovative systems with practical building operations,
              ensuring solutions are reliable, scalable, and easy to manage in
              real environments. We carefully design and implement systems that
              help buildings operate more efficiently while reducing energy
              consumption and environmental impact.
